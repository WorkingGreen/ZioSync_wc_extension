# WooCommerce ZioSync REST API
This plugin extends the WooCommerce REST API with additional endpoints specifically designed for seamless integration with ZioSync. ZioSync is an application that facilitates the transfer of order data from WooCommerce to various accounting platforms, such as Exact Online.

## Description
Out-of-the-box WooCommerce provides a robust REST API, but certain scenarios, especially when dealing with complex order data synchronization to external accounting systems, require more tailored data retrieval and manipulation. This plugin fills that gap by exposing new API endpoints that provide the necessary data in a format optimized for ZioSync's operations.

## Support
For issues or questions regarding this plugin's integration with ZioSync, please refer to the ZioSync documentation or contact their support channel.
